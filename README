This program takes in a string (in RPN notation), tokenizes it and if it a digit 
it pushes it onto the stack. Otherwise, if it is a punctuation mark is pops digits
off the stack and preforms the specificed operation. The following operations are 
supported: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

The program will not accept expressions with too many operators, too many operands
or an invalid operator.
